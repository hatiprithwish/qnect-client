# Project Structure

## Route-Based Folder Structure

This project uses a route-based folder structure for organizing pages and components.

### Pages Folder Structure

- When a new route is created, a folder with the same name will be added in the `pages` folder
- Inside this folder, there will be an entry point file named `index.tsx`
- The `index.tsx` file will only contain the layout of the route
- For nested routes (e.g., `/parent/child`), the folder structure will be: `pages/parent/child/index.tsx`

### Components Folder Structure

- In the `components` folder, a folder with the exact same name as the route will be created
- Inside this components folder, all components related to that route will be added
- For nested routes (e.g., `/parent/child`), the structure will be: `components/parent/child/`
- Components within these folders should be colocated with the route they belong to

### Example Structure

For a route `/practice/problems`:

```
pages/
  practice/
    problems/
      index.tsx          # Entry point with layout only

components/
  practice/
    problems/
      ProblemList.tsx
      ProblemCard.tsx
      # ... other components for this route
```

For a simple route `/home`:

```
pages/
  home/
    index.tsx            # Entry point with layout only

components/
  home/
    UserProfile.tsx
    Dashboard.tsx
    # ... other components for this route
```
